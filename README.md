# Hi there! <img width="94" height="81" alt="pngaaa com-5937086 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77360688-9d0c-409e-bc77-f5b536e1464b" />


This is my little corner where I publish my mini codes in C++. I just started learning it and I'm trying a lot of different things.

# My first project

## <a href="https://github.com/dakku7/Five-Night-s-at-Freddy-s-in-CMD"> Five-Nights-at-Freddys-in-CMD </a>

This project is a console-based adaptation of the Fnaf 1 from scratch, by me. The implementation is done in C++.

## Code 
- **Main Functionality**: The `main.cpp` file contains the main game loop, where threads for animatronic movement, energy management, and rendering are created and managed.
- **Game Logic**: The `func.h` and `func.cpp` files define the game classes, including `Map`, `Player`, and `Animatronic`.
- **Animatronic Behavior**: Each animatronic class (e.g., `Freddy`, `Chika`, `Bonny`, `Foxy`) inherits from the base `Animatronic` class.

## My thoughts
This is my very first relatively large project that I wrote in C++. I wanted to write something that interested me, and I chose Fnaf because I was very interested in it as a child. 

## P.S
If anyone sees this, I would appreciate any criticism or simply your opinion (I have only just started learning C++ and this is my first language).
